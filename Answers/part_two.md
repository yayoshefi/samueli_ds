# Part II:
    - Goal: Describe 2 approches to find the L3 from CT scan

## Results:

### Approach A:
    - find "blobs" - that are the section of the spine
    - starting from one end we can have an "anchor" to stat searching up the spine

### Approch B:
    - I have no idea for another way
    - I need some anchor that is a know fact we can start from

### TODO

## Future work
